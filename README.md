# Regis MSDS Python self-assesment
This self-assesment should be passed (getting 5 or more questions correct) prior to starting MSDS600 in the Regis MSDS program. There is no limit to the number of times you take the assessment. Feel free to reach out to Regis MSDS faculty if you have other questions or need more help (faculty can be found under the "Data Sciences" department [here](https://www.regis.edu/academics/faculty-finder/index)).

To take the assessment, you should first make sure you can run Jupyter Notebooks. Usually the easiest way to do this is by [installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), then running the Anaconda Navigator application once it is installed. From there you can launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. You can also fork the Kaggle kernel of the assessment [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/regis-python-self-assessment) and run it on Kaggle. There is a short intro video on how to get started with the assessment [here](https://youtu.be/wwTyWwMyPJw).

If running locally on your own computer, download this repository (e.g. clicking the green "code" button then "Download ZIP" or by cloning the repository with a GitHub client like the GitHub GUI). Open the `Self_assesment.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook from Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, complete the coding tasks, and run the last cell to show your score. 

You may use any resources you want during the assessment (e.g. books, the web) and there is no time limit. If you get 5 or more questions correct, you are ready for MSDS600. If you don't get at least 5 questions correct, you should use online resources to learn some Python basics before starting MSDS600.

Some good online resources for learning Python are:
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) (good for beginners)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) (not intended for complete beginners)
- [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-for-data-science-fundamentals/)
- [DataCamp's Python track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-fundamentals) (the intro/intermediate Python courses, good for beginners)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) (good for beginners)
