# Python_self_assesment
This self-assesment should be passed prior to starting MSDS600 in the Regis MSDS program. You should first make sure you have Python installed ([instructions here](https://github.com/nateGeorge/Python_getting_started)). Then open the `Self_assesment.ipynb` file with Jupyter Notebook, complete the coding tasks, and run the last cell to show your score. You may use any resources you want during the assessment (e.g. books, the web). If you score 70% or above, you are ready for MSDS600. If you do not score 70% or above, you should do one of the following:

- take MSC575 Statistical Computing from Regis
- use online resources to learn some Python basics

Some good online resources for learning Python are:
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) (not intended for complete beginners)
- [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-for-data-science-fundamentals/)
- [DataCamp's Python track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-fundamentals) (the intro/intermediate Python courses)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)

Feel free to contact one of the MSDS faculty for more advice.
