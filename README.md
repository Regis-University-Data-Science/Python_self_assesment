# Regis MSDS Python Self-Assessment
This self-assessment should be passed by answering **five** or more questions correctly before starting MSDS600 in the Regis MSDS program. There is no limit on the number of times you can take the assessment. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to the Regis MSDS faculty, which can be found in the "Marketing and Data Sciences" department [here](https://www.regis.edu/academics/faculty-finder/index).

To complete the assessment, make sure you can run [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). The easiest way to do this is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success). After installation, open the Anaconda Navigator application. You can launch `Jupyter Notebook` or `Jupyter Lab` from there. Alternatively, you can fork the Kaggle kernel for the assessment [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/regis-python-self-assessment) and run it on Kaggle. Additionally, there is a short introductory video on how to get started with the evaluation, which you can find [here](https://youtu.be/wwTyWwMyPJw).

If you are running the code on your own computer, download this repository by clicking the green "Code" button and then selecting "Download ZIP," or by cloning the repository using a GitHub client like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/). Open the `self_assessment.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in either Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Complete the coding tasks and run the last cell to see your score.

You can use any resources during the assessment, such as books or websites, without a time limit. If you answer **five** or more questions correctly, you are ready for MSDS600. However, if you score fewer than five correct answers, you should utilize online resources to learn the basics of Python before starting MSDS600.

Some good online resources for learning Python are:
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) (good for beginners)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) (not intended for complete beginners)
- [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-for-data-science-fundamentals/)
- [DataCamp's Python track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-fundamentals) (the intro/intermediate Python courses, good for beginners)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) (good for beginners)
